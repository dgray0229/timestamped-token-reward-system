# Error Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the errors that were identified and fixed in the application.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. Phantom Wallet Adapter Warning

**Error**: "Phantom was registered as a Standard Wallet. The Wallet Adapter for Phantom can be removed from your app."

**Root Cause**: Phantom wallet now implements the Standard Wallet interface and no longer needs explicit adapter registration.

**Solution**:

- Removed `PhantomWalletAdapter` import from `WalletProvider.tsx` and `SolanaProviderWrapper.tsx`
- Removed explicit Phantom wallet registration from wallet arrays
- Phantom will now auto-register itself as a standard wallet

**Files Modified**:

- `apps/web/src/components/WalletProvider.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/SolanaProviderWrapper.tsx`

### 2. CORS Policy Errors

**Error**: "Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is present on the requested resource" blocking requests from `https://tokenrewards.devingray.io` to `https://charismatic-rejoicing-production.up.railway.app`

**Root Cause**: Backend CORS configuration wasn't set to allow the production frontend domain.

**Solution**:

- Updated backend CORS configuration to automatically use production domain when `NODE_ENV=production`
- Added production domain `https://tokenrewards.devingray.io` as default CORS origin for production
- Created deployment guide for setting `CORS_ORIGIN` environment variable on Railway

**Files Modified**:

- `apps/api/src/config/index.ts`
- `apps/api/.env.example`
- `.env.example`

**New File**: `RAILWAY_CORS_FIX.md` (deployment instructions)

### 3. Authentication Failed

**Error**: "Authentication failed" due to message format mismatch between frontend and backend

**Root Cause**: Frontend and backend were using different signature message formats:

- Frontend: ISO timestamp string
- Backend: Unix timestamp number

**Solution**:

- Updated shared package `generateSignatureMessage` function to match backend format
- Changed frontend to use Unix timestamp (number) instead of ISO string
- Ensured message format consistency: "Welcome to Reward System!\n\nWallet: {address}\nNonce: {nonce}\nTimestamp: {timestamp}\n\nThis request will not trigger..."

**Files Modified**:

- `packages/shared/src/all-types.ts`

---

### 4. Buffer is not defined Error

**Error**: "TypeError: Right side of assignment cannot be destructured" and "Buffer is not defined"

**Root Cause**: Browser doesn't have Node.js `Buffer` global, used in `WalletConnection.tsx` for base64 encoding.

**Solution**:

- Replaced `Buffer.from(signatureBytes).toString('base64')` with native browser API
- Used `btoa(String.fromCharCode(...signatureBytes))` for base64 encoding
- Updated test files to use `Uint8Array` instead of `Buffer`

**Files Modified**:

- `apps/web/src/components/WalletConnection.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/test/utils.tsx`

---

### 5. Host Validation Errors (No Action Required)

**Error**: "Host validation failed", "Host is not supported", etc.

**Root Cause**: Browser extensions (ad blockers, password managers, etc.) checking if they should run on this domain.

**Solution**: Already handled correctly by global error handler - these errors are filtered out as they're not from our application.

**Status**: No changes needed - working as intended.

---

### 6. Sentry 429 Errors (Optimized)

**Error**: Sentry rate limiting (HTTP 429) blocking error reporting

**Root Cause**: High volume of error reports hitting Sentry rate limits.

**Solution**:

- Enhanced error filtering to ignore more rate limit related errors
- Existing circuit breaker already handles Sentry 429s by pausing error reporting for 5 minutes
- Added more rate limit patterns to ignored errors list

**Files Modified**:

- `apps/web/src/utils/globalErrorHandler.ts`

## üöÄ Deployment Requirements

### Railway Backend Deployment

To complete the CORS fix, set this environment variable in Railway:

```
CORS_ORIGIN=https://tokenrewards.devingray.io
```

### Expected Results After Deployment

1. ‚úÖ No Phantom wallet adapter warnings
2. ‚úÖ CORS requests succeed from production frontend to backend
3. ‚úÖ Wallet authentication works correctly
4. ‚úÖ No Buffer-related runtime errors
5. ‚úÖ Host validation errors filtered out (no console noise)
6. ‚úÖ Reduced Sentry error spam

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Application builds successfully
- [ ] Development server starts without errors
- [ ] Phantom wallet connects without warnings
- [ ] Authentication flow completes (after CORS fix deployment)
- [ ] No Buffer errors in console
- [ ] Extension errors properly filtered from console

## üìù Next Steps

1. Deploy the API changes to Railway with the CORS_ORIGIN environment variable
2. Deploy the frontend changes to production
3. Test the complete wallet connection flow in production
4. Monitor error reporting to ensure Sentry rate limits are reduced
