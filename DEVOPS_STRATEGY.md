- **Quality Gates**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript checks
- **Automated Testing**: Jest/Vitest with database services
- **Container Building**: Multi-stage Docker builds with caching
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability and secret detection

#### **CD Workflow** (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`)
- **Sequential Deployment**: API first, then Web
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive service validation
- **Integration Testing**: Post-deployment validation
- **Auto-Rollback**: Failure detection and recovery

#### **Security Workflow** (`.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`)
- **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit with vulnerability detection
- **Code Analysis**: CodeQL static analysis
- **Container Security**: Trivy image scanning
- **Environment Validation**: Configuration completeness checks

#### **Rollback Workflow** (`.github/workflows/rollback.yml`)
- **Manual Rollback**: Emergency rollback procedures
- **Backup Creation**: Pre-rollback state preservation
- **Incident Tracking**: Automatic issue creation
- **Validation Testing**: Post-rollback verification

### 2. Platform Configuration

#### **Railway Setup**
```bash
# API Service Configuration
Service: api
Root Directory: apps/api
Build Command: npm run build
Start Command: npm start
Health Check: /health
```

```bash
# Web Service Configuration
