# Netlify Build Fix - Monorepo Configuration

## Problem Solved ‚úÖ

**Original Error**: TypeScript couldn't find `@reward-system/shared` module during Netlify build.

**Root Cause**: Netlify was trying to build only the `apps/web` directory without building the shared package dependencies first.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Moved Configuration to Root
- **Moved** `netlify.toml` from `apps/web/` to repository root
- **Removed** `base = "apps/web"` to build from repo root instead

### 2. Created Build Script
- **Created** `build-netlify.sh` script for reliable build process
- **Added** `.nvmrc` file to ensure Node.js version 20
- **Made** build script executable

### 3. Updated netlify.toml
```toml
[build]
  # Build settings for monorepo structure
  publish = "apps/web/dist"
  command = "./build-netlify.sh"
  environment = { NODE_VERSION = "20", YARN_VERSION = "1.22.22" }
```

### 4. Build Process Flow
The build script now:
1. ‚úÖ Installs all workspace dependencies
2. ‚úÖ Builds `@reward-system/shared` package first
3. ‚úÖ Builds the web app with all dependencies available
4. ‚úÖ Outputs to correct `apps/web/dist` directory

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `/netlify.toml` (moved from apps/web/)
- `/build-netlify.sh` (executable build script)
- `/.nvmrc` (Node.js version specification)

### Environment Variables Set:
Your environment variables are already configured correctly in Netlify:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://charismatic-rejoicing-production.up.railway.app/api/v1
VITE_API_TIMEOUT=10000
VITE_SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet
VITE_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
VITE_APP_NAME=Timestamped Token Reward System
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
VITE_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
VITE_ENABLE_ERROR_REPORTING=true
VITE_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=true
NODE_VERSION=20
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Netlify build configuration for monorepo

- Move netlify.toml to root for proper monorepo handling
- Create build script to build shared package first
- Add .nvmrc for consistent Node.js version
- Update build command to use reliable script"
git push
```

### 2. Netlify Will Auto-Deploy
- Netlify will detect the new commit
- It will use the updated configuration
- The build should now succeed ‚úÖ

### 3. Verify Deployment
After successful build:
- ‚úÖ Frontend loads without errors
- ‚úÖ API connection to Railway backend works
- ‚úÖ Solana wallet integration functions
- ‚úÖ React Router navigation works properly

## What Changed in the Build Process

### Before (‚ùå Failed):
```
apps/web/ build ‚Üí Missing @reward-system/shared
```

### After (‚úÖ Success):
```
Repository root ‚Üí Install all deps ‚Üí Build shared ‚Üí Build web ‚Üí Success
```

## Testing Verification ‚úÖ

Local build test confirmed:
- Shared package builds successfully
- Web app builds with all dependencies
- Output directory structure is correct
- Build script executes without errors

Your Netlify deployment should now work perfectly! üöÄ
